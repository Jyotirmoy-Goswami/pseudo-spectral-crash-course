# Quiz (Lecture 12)

## Quiz - 7: 

The 2D algorithm I described today for the tracer particles (interpolating from grid to particle position) had 4 if-conditions . Now check out the 'big' expression (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.12707.pdf, Page No 7, Section VI, A, at the bottom part of the page) and tell me how many if-conditions  you have to write for this case?
