# Quizzes for Lecture - 3

### Quiz - 1: 
Can you modify the 1D Burgers code, and reproduce electron-plasma-oscillation? 

(Hint: Look at the plasma oscillation section of Davidson's book)

### Quiz - 2: 
And eventually increase the amplitude of perturbation and see how does the plasma frequency changes as nonlinearity enters via large amplitude perturbation. Remember, our code successfully passed one of the most difficult tests of nonlinearity - the shock problem!!!
