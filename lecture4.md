# Lecture 4: 
As promised, I solved the two dimensional Poisson solver using multi-dimensional FFTW library, but before that, I revised the numerical subtleties of multi-dimensional FFTW library that I described in the last lecture. The revision took almost half of the lecture and in the rest of the part I showed the numerical implementation as an extension of the program written in the last lecture. At the fag end I talked about some seminal benchmarking papers for two dimensional fluid codes!
