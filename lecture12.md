# Lecture 12: 
The first part of this lecture extends over a set of previous lecture series on molecular-dynamics simulation and then smoothly connects to "smooth particle hydrodynamics" and enters into the pseudo-spectral code we developed in [Lecture 5](#lecture-5) and [6](#lecture-6). Finally I talked about adding some passive tracer particles delineating some crude and very basic idea about particle-in-cell algorithm and particle pusher schemes we used in the molecular-dynamics simulation series lecture. In between the lecture I also have stressed the need of the implementation of this scheme and its potential applications!
