# Lecture 5: 
This is probably the most crucial lecture. Starting from last [lecture's code](code/poisson_2d.md), I developed a two dimensional incompressible fluid solver. In the first part I described the basic equaitons to be solved in the vorticity - stream-function formalism at length and then developed the code. Unfortunately, the code had a bug which I later identified and pointed out in the beginning of the next lecture.
